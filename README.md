# U2U Chain RPC Scripts üåêüíª

Welcome to the U2U Chain RPC Scripts repository! This repository contains JavaScript scripts to interact with the U2U chain network using RPC (Remote Procedure Call) methods. Whether you're querying block information, executing contract calls, fetching chain IDs, or estimating gas for transactions, these scripts demonstrate how to achieve these tasks programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) - Node.js package manager

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yllvar/U2U-Chain-RPC-Scripts.git
   cd u2u-chain-rpc
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts Overview

### eth_blockNumber

Fetches the current block number from the U2U chain network.

### eth_call

Executes a message call to a smart contract without creating a transaction. Useful for querying contract states or testing transactions.

### eth_chainId

Returns the currently configured chain ID, essential for transaction signing and network identification (EIP-155).

### eth_estimateGas

Estimates the gas required for a transaction without executing it on the blockchain, helping in cost estimation and transaction planning.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use Node.js:

```bash
node <script-name>.js
```

Replace `<script-name>` with the name of the script you want to execute (e.g., `getBlockNumber.js`, `ethCall.js`).

Make sure to customize the script parameters such as contract addresses, encoded data, etc., according to your needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to improve the scripts, feel free to submit a pull request.
